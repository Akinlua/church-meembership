# Mac Auto-Update Error - FIXED ✅

## What Happened

You got this error when trying to download an update:
```
An error occurred while checking for updates.
ZIP file not provided
```

## Root Cause

For **Mac auto-updates**, electron-updater requires a **`.zip` file**, but your build was only generating a `.dmg` file.

- **DMG** = Manual download/installation (drag to Applications folder)
- **ZIP** = Auto-update file (electron-updater extracts and updates automatically)

## The Fix

I updated `package.json` to build **BOTH** formats for Mac:

```json
"mac": {
  "target": [
    {
      "target": "zip",    // ← For auto-updates
      "arch": ["x64", "arm64"]
    },
    {
      "target": "dmg",    // ← For manual downloads
      "arch": ["x64", "arm64"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Delete the v1.0.3 Release (Optional but Recommended)

Since it doesn't have the zip file, delete it from GitHub:
- Go to https://github.com/Akinlua/church-meembership/releases
- Find v1.0.3
- Click "Delete" (or you can add the zip file manually if you rebuild)

### 2. Rebuild for Mac

```bash
cd /Users/user/Documents/church_membership/church-meembership/src/frontend
npm run electron:build:mac
```

This will now create:
- `ChurchMembership-1.0.3-mac.zip` ← **This is what was missing!**
- `ChurchMembership-1.0.3.dmg`
- `ChurchMembership-1.0.3-arm64.dmg`
- `ChurchMembership-1.0.3-x64.dmg`
- `latest-mac.yml`

### 3. Create New v1.0.3 Release

Upload these files to GitHub release v1.0.3:

**For Mac Users:**
- ✅ `ChurchMembership-1.0.3-mac.zip` (universal - **REQUIRED for auto-updates**)
- ✅ `ChurchMembership-1.0.3.dmg` (universal)
- ✅ `latest-mac.yml` (update manifest)

**For Windows Users (if you built for Windows):**
- ✅ `ChurchMembership-Setup-1.0.3.exe`
- ✅ `latest.yml`

### 4. Test Again

Now when you run the app and it checks for updates:
1. ✅ It will find the update
2. ✅ It will download the `.zip` file successfully
3. ✅ It will extract and update automatically

## File Structure After Build

```
dist/
├── mac/
│   ├── ChurchMembership-1.0.3-mac.zip     ← Auto-update file
│   ├── ChurchMembership-1.0.3.dmg         ← Manual install
│   ├── ChurchMembership-1.0.3-arm64.dmg
│   ├── ChurchMembership-1.0.3-x64.dmg
│   └── latest-mac.yml                     ← Update manifest
└── win/
    ├── ChurchMembership-Setup-1.0.3.exe
    └── latest.yml
```

## Quick Reference

| Platform | Auto-Update File | Manual Install | Manifest |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Windows** | `.exe` | `.exe` | `latest.yml` |
| **Mac** | `.zip` | `.dmg` | `latest-mac.yml` |

## Why Both ZIP and DMG for Mac?

- **ZIP**: Electron-updater extracts this automatically for seamless updates
- **DMG**: Users who want to manually download/install (first install, or if auto-update fails)

---

**The fix is complete!** Just rebuild and re-upload the release. 🎉
